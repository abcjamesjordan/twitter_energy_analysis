# Twitter Energy Sector Analysis

This project is aimed at applying data analysis, machine learning, and Python skills towards understanding more about the energy sector via Twitter.

## About
Motivation for this project comes from my upcoming interview with a company that utilizes energy data to build market simulation models.

## Requirements
Python libraries:

1. Twint: to scrape tweets based on search parameters (coal energy, solar energy, wind energy, natural gas energy, and petroleum energy).
2. Pandas: to organize the tweets into a tabular form
3. Scikit-learn: to build the sentiment analysis SVC model
4. Matplotlib / Seaborn: visualize the results.
5. Wordcloud: to visulize the results from the mentions and hashtags in an easy to digest manner.
6. Textblob: apply sentiment analysis to tweets and predict future sentiment

## Methods
1. Scrape tweets using twint
2. Train sentiment ML model
3. Organize tweets and apply ML to all tweets
4. Visualize results
5. Future Improvements...
